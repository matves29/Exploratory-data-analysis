	abstract = {High-speed train operation data are reliable and rich resources in data-driven research. However, the data released by railway companies are poorly organized and not comprehensive enough to be applied directly and effectively. A public high-speed railway network dataset suitable for research is still lacking. To support the research in large-scale complex network, complex dynamic system and intelligent transportation, we develop a high-speed railway network dataset, containing the train operation data in different directions from October 8, 2019 to January 27, 2020, the train delay data of the railway stations, the junction stations data, and the mileage data of adjacent stations. In the dataset, weather, temperature, wind power and major holidays are considered as factors affecting train operation. Potential research values of the dataset include but are not limited to complex dynamic system pattern mining, community detection and discovery, and train delay analysis. Besides, the dataset can be used to solve various railway operation and management problems, such as passenger service network improvement, train real-time dispatching and intelligent driving assistance.},

	abstract = {Severe rainfall often affects train travel times in a high-speed railway network through speed restrictions and facility failures. The disturbance impact reduces the travel experience for passengers and creates enormous difficulties for train reception and departure at stations. This study presents a method for analysing the disturbance impacts of severe rainfall on train travel time in high-speed railway networks, focusing on the heterogeneity of impacts under different spatial–temporal rainfall scenarios. The average delay of trains at each study station under rainfall conditions is obtained by utilising a Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on kernel density estimation. Taking China’s high-speed railway as an example, we calculate the extent of delays and fluctuations in train travel time for different spatial–temporal rainfall scenarios and identify corresponding critical stations, lines, and rainfall periods. The results show that rainfall in the eastern study area has the greatest disturbance impact on train travel time, causing the extent of train delays and travel time fluctuations averaging 17.64 min/1000 km and 7.18 \%. Temporally, the impacts caused by rainfall occurring from 6:00 to 9:00 in the eastern study area are more significant, while rainfall from 12:00 to 15:00 has lesser impacts. Meanwhile, when rainfall occurs from 15:00 to 18:00 in the eastern study area, greater attention should be given to the Ningbo station and the Nanjing-Shanghai railway section. The uneven distribution of train flows and their operational characteristics are the main reasons that impacts have spatial–temporal differences. The study conclusions can provide a reference basis for operation managers to adjust train operation schedules under real rainfall scenarios.},

A possible rock-dwelling habit is inferred for M. mundjabus, an ecological niche no other Macropus (sensu stricto) is known to have exploited.},

	abstract = {1 The wolf Canis lupus, the most widespread of the four species of large carnivores in Europe, after centuries of population decline and eradication, is now recovering in many countries. Wolves contribute to regulating prey–predator dynamics and interact with human activities, mainly livestock farming and ungulate hunting. Although wolves are protected in most European countries, illegal or incidental killing is widespread. 2 Wolf populations do not show any apparent phylogeographic structuring worldwide. Molecular and morphological studies of historical samples showed evidence of wolf ecomorph extinctions, coinciding with the great Pleistocene faunal turnover. 3 Extant populations show recurrent long-range dispersal during cycles of expansion and recolonization. Demographically stable populations, in contrast, seem to be characterized by very limited gene flow. 4 Despite the potential for dispersal and ecological flexibility, landscape genetic approaches have demonstrated the existence of genetically distinct wolf populations, which originated through habitat and prey specializations. 5 Small isolated wolf populations may suffer from inbreeding depression, although selection for heterozygotes and the rescue effect can foster rapid population recovery. Population structure and dynamics is efficiently monitored by non-invasive genetic methods, which are also useful to identify wolf × dogCanis lupus familiaris hybridization. 6 Despite technical advances and a better knowledge of wolf biology, wolf conservation is largely dependent on humans, and on the solution of conflicts with stakeholders.},
