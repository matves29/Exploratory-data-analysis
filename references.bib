	abstract = {Tremendous efforts have been made in the last few decades to develop new energy sources that can replace the conventional power sources which relay on fossil resources. Among the different alternative power sources, the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell ({PEMFC}) is considered one of the most promising alternative clean power generators, since it offer the possibility of zero-emission by converting the chemical energy stored in hydrogen fuel directly into electricity with water as the only by-product. The performance of the {PEM} fuel cell depends on the materials used for the main components of the fuel cell such as the membrane electrode assembly and the bipolar flow plates. Development of new materials and enhancing the current ones will pioneer the {PEM} fuel cell technology. In the light of this, this paper is an attempt to highlight and address the materials used for manufacturing the main components of the {PEMFC} and their current status of development. First, it highlights the need for {PEMFC} as a power source, reviews the potential applications and addresses the main challenges of the technology. Then, the basic working fundamentals and performance of {PEM} fuel cell are highlighted. Finally, a detailed overview of the main fuel cell components, their materials, and their development status is provided.},

	abstract = {Reducing the silver film to 10 nm theoretically allows higher transparency but in practice leads to degraded transparency and electrical conductivity because the ultrathin film tends to be discontinuous. Herein, we developed a thinning-back process to address this dilemma, in which silver film is first deposited to a larger thickness with high continuity and then thinned back to a reduced thickness with an ultrasmooth surface, both implemented by a flood ion beam. Contributed by the shallow implantation of silver atoms into the substrate during deposition, the thinness of silver films down to 4.5 nm can be obtained, thinner than ever before. The atomic-level surface smooth permits excellent visible transparency, electrical conductivity, and the lowest haze among all existing transparent conductors. Moreover, the ultrathin silver film exhibits the unique robustness of mechanical flexibility. Therefore, the ion-beam thinning-back process presents a promising solution towards the excellent transparent conductor for flexible optoelectronic devices.},

In this work, the {CSW}, which length could reach 230 μm, was fabricated from the {PG} in a glycerol–water solution. It could be found that the glycerol–water volume ratio of 4:6 was the best ratio that could reduce the water activity and accelerate the phase transition from calcium sulfate dihydrate ({CSD}) to {CSW}. Meanwhile, the {CSW}, after calcination, could prepare the anhydrous calcium sulfate whisker ({ACSW}) with low solubility in water; when the {ACSW} substitution rate reached 50\%, the property of the complex paper could still satisfy the standard of mechanical and optical for offset book paper.},

Here, we prepared {MCM}-41-coated {NiFe}2O4 magnetic nanoparticles and modified their surface with phosphotungstic acid ({PWA}) and then sulfate. We tested the catalysts’ efficiency and reusability toward the formation of xanthene and coumarin derivatives. The prepared magnetic nanoparticles were found to be easily recovered from the reaction mixture and reused up to several runs without a noticeable decrease in the catalytic activity. The samples have been characterized by {SEM}, {TEM}, {FTIR}, {XRD}, {VSM}, and {XPS}. {XPS} indicated the presence of the inverse-cubic spinel phase of {NiFe}2O4 and the contribution of Fe({III})–O and Ni({II})–O bonds in tetrahedral (Th) and octahedral (Oh) sites. The results indicated the good dispersion of sulfate and {PWA} nanoparticles on the surface and inside the pores of {NF}-{MCM}-41 which play an important role in increasing the acidity and activity of the catalyst toward the synthesis of xanthene and coumarin derivatives. The catalyst 20S-W/{NF}-{MCM}-41-{II} reveals the highest acidity (Ei = 586.3 {mV}) and yields 93.92\% 14-aryl-14H-dibenzo[a, j]xanthene and 78.32\% 7-hydroxy-4-methyl coumarin.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of four-armed materials based on a pentaerythritol core, which is connected by spacers with different lengths to the coumarin moieties as mesogenic groups, is reported. The chemical structure of compounds is confirmed by {FT}-{IR}, 1H, 13C {NMR}, and mass spectrometery ({MS}). {UV}-Vis spectroscopy measurements exhibited a red shift in peaks of coumarin ring from 318 to 366 nm compared with free coumarin molecules, which is attributed to the developed π–π interactions by possible formation of liquid crystal structures. These materials are interesting regarding their potential application in {LCDs}.},

	abstract = {The article solves the problem of ensuring effective corporate governance through the study of social effects and such a phenomenon as employee resistance to change. The main purpose of the study is to develop practical ways of increasing the effectiveness of corporate governance by assessing the intensity of employee resistance to change in turbulent external socioeconomic conditions based on the business analytics platform. To achieve this, the authors compared theoretical thinking with empirical testing methods. This study was conducted using the methods of analysis and synthesis, surveys, expert evaluations, and the method of taxonomy. The results revealed: (1) Reliability and sustainability of survey tools; (2) Dependence of employee resistance to change on individual psychological and socio-psychological reasons and organizational barriers; (3) The effectiveness of assessing the level of intensity of employee resistance to organizational change in negative socio-economic conditions based on the calculation of the integrated coefficient; (4) The importance of effective work of {HR} managers that is aimed at overcoming employee resistance to change in order to achieve positive social effects. We have determined that achieving strategic goals of the company's development through the implementation of corporate governance is conditioned by positive organizational change, for the successful implementation of which it is necessary to assess the employee resistance to change in order to effectively overcome it. The study substantiates the main groups of reasons for persistent employee resistance to change. We offer practical recommendations on how to assess the intensity of employee resistance to change. In the course of additional research, proposals for successful planning of employee development programs were formulated. Positive social external effects of corporate governance effectiveness were determined.},
