# Exploratory-data-analysis
Small repo with example files of exploratory data analysis using R and Quarto

The repository contains two example-files rendered as html.

* A quarto of entirely random data gihtlighting how quarto can be easily used to present analysis outputs in an article like format.
* A cursory, exploratory analysis of train delay data that highlights a potential path for exploring a new dataset.

For the exploratory analysis we have created two version the one with the suffix _KTH uses the packages ktheme (for colors when plotting) and the kth-quarto template. While the file without a suffix uses viridis for colors.
